    <h1>&#9830; Lilly Blum: A Creative Influence :') &#9830; </h1>
    
        <!--introduction to my sister -->
        <p>Some people say that a sister is created to be the bane of one's existence. Not in my case. My sister is probably one of the most influential people in my life in more ways than one. However, this assignment calls for me to illustrate who a person who is the most influential for me creatively. So yeah, maybe my sister IS the one who influences me most creatively. Not because she is good at art (she really is though, check her graphics <a href="https://lillyblum.format.com/2875937-portfolio" target="_blank"> here</a> ) but because she pushes my buttons in more ways than one. </p>

            <h2> A Brief Overview of My Sister</h2>
    
            <!-- what the h2 title says-->    
        <p> My sister is kinda cool. Here are a few reasons why I'm writing this homework all about her</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>She makes really cool things.</li>
                    <ul> 
                <li> Like this physical wooden thingy.</li>

                <li> Or this, uh, hand with a face on it...</li>
                        <img src="BLUM_HOMEWORK2/HAND.jpg" alt="hand thing" width="480" height="270">
                    </ul>
                <li>She always sends me little graphics that she makes</li>
                <li>We fight about what is the correct way to read a map</li>
                <li>We bounce ideas off of each other constantly</li>
                <li>We both want to use our brother as our muse (but only one of us succeeds)</li>    
                      </ol>
        </div>
    
   <!--a few images showcasing our creative abilities-->     
        
        <h2> Our Collaboration</h2> 
        
        <p>My sister and I always talk about collaborating. We have so many ideas and images that we bounce back and forth, but we've only ever collaborated two times. Check the images below. </p>

        <h4> Oh, and here's another time where she used my face as her reference... though it really doesn't look like me in my opinion</h4>
